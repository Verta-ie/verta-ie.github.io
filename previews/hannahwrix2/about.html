                            <p style="line-height: 200%; font-size:22px;  font-weight: 400;">Last Minute Minders came to life in 2007 and was established by Hannah Wrixon who recognised a need for staffing support in the childcare industry.</p>
                            <p>Hannah ran a successful crèche in Limerick for a number of years and knows the difficulties that face childcare providers around staffing, in particular maintaining ratios in the event of staff absences. As a parent of three Hannah also recognised the struggles that all working parents face around childcare. Last Minute Minders was initially born to address these needs.</p>
                            <p>We have adapted and grown the business in line with our customer’s needs over the years and now offer a suite of services to support them.</p>
                            <p>Last Minute Minders is a community of childcare professionals who are Garda vetted, qualified, reference checked and interviewed. Our rigorous pre-screening means that only the very best minders are accepted into our community.</p>
                            <p>We with our Minders have the knowledge and experience to offer solutions that work for you.</p>

                            <p>We introduce users of our service to these amazing minders for relief and emergency support.</p>
                            <p>Each minder has an online profile where they can set their availability, preferred work locations and manage their work.</p>
                            <p>Our community of Minders have gone through our rigorous screening process to become a member. This means that they are now available to support creches, hotels and parents.</p>
                            <p>All of our minders are self employed contractors who work independently.</p>
